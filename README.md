# Assignment
Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay.

## Formulas
Gross Pay = Hours * Rate

## Starter code
```python
# This first line is provided for you

hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
```

## Desired Output
Please note, your gross pay should be printed by itself on its own line.

```python
Enter Hours: 35
Enter Rate: 2.75
96.25
```

## Testing
1. Open your terminal, make sure it's pointed at the right files
2. Type in `pytest` and hit enter to see if your code passes!

## Note:
Please pay attention to types... if you try to multiply 2 strings, you will probably get an error.  You may need to `cast` your input to be a number type.
